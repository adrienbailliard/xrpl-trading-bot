# How It Works

The XRPL Trading Bot is designed to make intelligent market-making decisions on the XRP Ledger, while keeping users informed of its activities via Discord. It efficiently manages wallets, processes market data in real time, and executes transactions through continuous communication with the network.

## ðŸ”„ Workflow

1. **Initialization**
  
   The bot loads the configuration from `config.json` and prepares to interact with both the XRP Ledger and Discord.

2. **Connecting to the XRP Ledger**

   The bot establishes a connection to the XRP Ledger, subscribes to relevant data streams, and monitors the server's synchronization status.

3. **Synchronization Established**

   Once synchronization is achieved, the bot configures issuers, wallets, and market settings based on the provided configuration, and begins the trading process.

4. **Monitor and Process Transactions**

   The bot continuously listens for incoming transactions, updating its internal data to dynamically adjust market positions.

5. **Sync Loss Recovery**

   In case of a synchronization loss, the bot resets and returns to step 3 to resume normal operation.
